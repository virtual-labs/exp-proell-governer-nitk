#### These procedure steps will be followed on the simulator

1. In simulation window front, top view and free-body diagram of Proell governor is displayed.<br>

2. Speed control and mass control pointer is given in the variable tab, respective height is displayed below it and, under the control tab a checkbox for the graph is available.<br>

3. Move the slider knob to the right, under the rpm and mass to see the change in the animation of the porter governor, the rpm can change from 100 to 130 rpm and mass cam be changed from 4 to 6 kg.<br>

4. When **Show Graph** checkbox is checked, a graph and theoretical correlation is displayed. This graph shows the trend of governor height on varying the rotational speed of governor.<br>

5. For the experiments select **Go to Experiment** in the control panel <br>

6. On the experiment page in the simulator user can select two experiment, calculation or identifying the parts on the simulator screen. Control panel can be used to start the experiment or go back to the simulation.<br>

7. In the calculation experiment, constant variables, height and mass graph is given for the calculation of the mass, user can verify their mass from the check box. User can use the **Reset Experiment** option in the control panel to reset the experiment for new calculation. For going back to choose the experiment **Exit Experiment** button can be used in control panel.<br>

8. In the identify parts of the governor experiment, a Proell governor  setup in the middle of the simulation screen, different parts of the governor have the dropdown box where user can choose the part name and verify at the same time.<br>
