Q 1. The height of a governor is distance measure from<br>
a. the center of two balls mass<br>
<b>b. the center of balls mass to the point of intersection of upper arms</b><br>
c. the center of balls mass to the point of intersection of lower links<br>
d. the point of intersection of upper arms to the point of intersection of lower links<br><br>

Q 2. What is the theoretical correlation between speed and height of the governor?<br>
<b>a. N<sup>2</sup>&Proportional;1/h<br></b>
b. N&Proportional;1/h<br>
c. N<sup>3</sup>&Proportional;1/h<br>
d. h&Proportional;N<br><br>

Q 3. The arms of proell governor are 300 mm long. The pivots of upper and lower arm are 30 mm from the axis. The load on the sleeve is 250N and weight of each ball is 30N. When the governor sleeve is at mid position the extension link of the lower arm is vertical and radius of rotation of the balls is 160 mm. The vertical height of governor is 200 mm. If speed of governor at mid-position is 150 rpm, find the length of extension link.<br>
a. 502mm<br>
<b>b. 232mm</b><br>
c. 270mm<br>
d. 320mm<br><br>

Q 4. From the simulator, at 128 rpm what is the approximate height of the governor<br>
a. 120mm<br>
<b>b. 160mm</b><br>
c. 200mm<br>
d. 240mm<br><br>
