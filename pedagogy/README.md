<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
1.|Student will be able to identify the parts of a proell governor such as flyball, spindle, link, arms, dead weight, sleeve |List the different Instruments used in the experiment. Explain the significance of each Instrument and its use in the experiment. |Q. Lightest fly balls used among these in<br>1) Watt governor<br>2) Porter governor<br><u>3) Proell governor</u><br>4) Equal weight in all<br><br>Q. The height of a governor is distance measure from<br>1) the centre of two balls mass<br><u>2) the centre of balls mass to the point of intersection of upper arms</u><br>3) the centre of balls mass to the point of intersection of  lower links<br>4)the point of intersection of upper arms to the point of intersection of  lower links<br>
2.|Student will be able to explain the working and uses of proell governor |Go through the simulation and perform the experiments to understand the working of the proell governor. |Q. When the user selects the “Experiment on calculation” and starts the experiment, the user will be asked to calculate the rpm or height or mass randomly selected by the simulation of the proell governor. The user will be provided with arbitrary values of mass, height, rpm, and the ratio of FM/BM (from free body diagram). The values will randomize each time the user clicks on the reset experiment. The user will use the generated constant values to calculate the RPM, height, and mass of the proell governor. The user can verify calculated value putting the value in the checkbox below<br><br>Q. When the user selects the “Experiment on identifying the parts” and starts the experiment, the user will be asked to identify the parts of the porter governor. The user will be given an image of the proell governor and will be asked to identify the part name in the drop-down box beside each part. The user can verify the correct part name in the checkbox.
3.| Student will be able to Calculate the height of the governor with respect of rotational speed  |Carryout calculation by using mathematical equation for finding certain values such as centrifugal force, angular speed of the ball and RPM|Q. The arms of proell governor are 300 mm long. The pivots of upper and lower arm are 30 mm from the axis. The load on the sleeve is 250N and weight of each ball is 30N. When the governor sleeve is at mid position the extension link of the lower arm is vertical and radius of rotation of the balls is 160 mm. The vertical height of governor is 200 mm. If speed of governor at mid-position is 150 rpm, find the length of extension link.<br>1) 502mm<br><u>2) 232 mm</u><br>3) 270 mm<br>4) 320 mm<br><br>Q. What is the theoretical correlation between speed and height of the governor?<br>1) Square of N directly proportional to h<br>2)N directly proportional to h<br><u>3) Square of N inversely proportional to h</u><br>4)N inversely proportional to h<br>

Which of the following statement is TRUE<br><u>1) The same equilibrium speed for m, M and H ball of smaller masses can be used in proell governor compare to porter governor.</u><br>2)The same equilibrium speed for m, M and H ball of larger masses can be used in proell governor compare to porter governor. <br>3)The same equilibrium speed for m, M and H ball of same masses can be used in proell governor compare to porter governor.<br>4)None of the above
5.| Student will be able to Note down the minimum and maximum height of governor to its rotational speed and examine the results by plotting the graph. | Plot the graph with generated data |Q. If height of the governor increases speed<br><u>1) decreases</u><br>2) increases<br>3) remains constant<br>4) none of above<br><br>Q.
